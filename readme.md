Key Components
main.py
The central script that coordinates the following tasks:

Data Loading:

Loads financial data from src/dataset/AAPL.csv.
Loads additional data from Yahoo Finance using yfinance.
Data Preprocessing:

Cleans and preprocesses the loaded data.
Scales and creates interaction terms for better model performance.
Univariate Analysis:

Performs and plots univariate analysis of the time series data.
Seasonal Decomposition:

Decomposes the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components.
Plots the decomposed components.
Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation:

Plots ACF and PACF to analyze the time series properties.
Model Training and Evaluation:

Trains ARIMA, ARIMAX, and XGBoost models on the dataset.
Evaluates the models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and precision.
Plots the model predictions and evaluation results.
